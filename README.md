# Python-XAMPP-Star-Schema
A graduate level project from CSCE 566 Data Mining, where a python mysql wrapper automatically creates a data mart using Star Schema in a MYSQL server. This alleviates the need for manually defining a data mart and sub tables (i.e. dimensions) such as "Customer" , "Product" can be reused multiple times for creating similar data marts within a bigger data warehouse

The code is solution to Q4 in Assignment 2 file.
